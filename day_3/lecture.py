# ITP Week 2 Day 3 Lecture

#Remember DRY (Do not repeat yourself!).  If you find yourself repeating code, assign that code to a variable and then simply use the variable where ever you would have written that function.

#You can import modules and get access to new functions.

# The modules that come with Python are called the standard library, but you can also install third-party modules using the pip tool.
# The sys.exit() function will immediately quit your program.

# The Pyperclip third-party module has copy() and paste() functions for reading and writing text to the clipboard().
