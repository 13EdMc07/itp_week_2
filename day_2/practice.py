# ITP Week 2 Day 2 (In-Class) Practice

# Functions I

#Write a function called use_poke_ball to print the text "You threw a poke ball!" and then call that function.

#Write a function called catch_pokemon that takes a single parameter, and then prints the words "You caught a " + the name of your favorite pokemon.  Remember to write the function with a parameter, and then call the function using a string.

#Write a function that combines the two function calls you already wrote into one function.  Define it as catchem_all.
